Hello everyone,

I have some exciting news to share with you! I've just got my Master's thesis back and it's been awarded a top grade of 1.0. To say that I'm thrilled would be an understatement.

First of all, a huge thanks to my professor, whose guidance was indispensable. Not to mention the dynamic interactions and brainstorming sessions with my seminar colleagues. These engagements added layers of depth and understanding to my work. This thesis wasn't just about putting in long hours (although there were plenty of those!). It was also about the joy of exploration, diving deep into a topic and coming up with new insights. Believe it or not, I had a lot of fun working on it.

The completion of this thesis marks the end of my undergraduate chapter. But the journey doesn't end here! I'm now excited to see what future projects I can contribute to. To mark this transition, I've decided to start writing about various topics that pique my interest. That's right! I've started a blog and will be posting regular updates about Mastodon. This platform will showcase numerous projects, large and small, that I've been working on over the past few years. It's a chance to share, learn and connect with like-minded people. Your support and feedback will be appreciated every step of the way.

To start with, you can read the abstract of my thesis below and find the full thesis [here](/thesis "Thesis").

Cheers!


## Abstract

*Scholars of democratic governance have provided substantial evidence of a lack of responsiveness to groups such as women, low-income populations, and minorities. However, the representation of young adults in the political process has received comparatively little attention. Existing research has focused primarily on the low numbers of young representatives in assemblies and the lack of conventional political participation, overlooking a critical question. Is there a gap in the representation of young adults in political outcomes? Adopting a comprehensive approach that integrates dynamic and group representation mechanisms, this thesis examines whether the interests of young voters are adequately met and identifies the key factors that influence legislators’ responsiveness. Using two-way linear fixed effects (2FE) regressions on data from 25 wealthy democracies over the past twenty years, the study identifies broad trends affecting the representation of young adults. Contrary to traditional assumptions, the results show that common characteristics, rather than electoral strategies, are the primary drivers of politicians’ deliberations. This challenges the prevailing narrative that low voter turnout among young adults is the primary reason for their underrepresentation. The study underscores the importance of group representation in shaping political outcomes, highlighting the urgent need to address numerical representation gaps, particularly in the face of impending demographic shifts toward older societies and increased dependence on young adults.*
