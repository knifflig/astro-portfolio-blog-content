Hello everyone,

I wanted to share an update regarding my studies: I've received feedback on my Master's thesis, and I'm grateful to say it has been graded as 1.0. It's indeed a satisfying moment, especially after the efforts and time invested.

A heartfelt acknowledgment to my professor; the guidance I received was invaluable. Equally enriching were the interactions and exchanges with my seminar peers. It was more than just the hours committed—it was about delving deep into a subject, navigating its intricacies, and deriving insights. I genuinely enjoyed each step.

While this thesis concludes a significant phase of my journey, it by no means signifies the end. I find myself eager to delve into new projects and challenges. With this transition, I've decided to pen down my thoughts and explorations more consistently. I've set up a blog and intend to share updates, including some on Mastodon. Through this platform, I hope to discuss some of the smaller and bigger projects I've undertaken in recent times. I look forward to sharing, learning, and connecting with those interested. Your perspectives, should you wish to share, will always be welcome.

For those curious about the thesis, the abstract is available below, and the complete document can be accessed [here](/thesis "Thesis").

Cheers!


## Abstract

*Scholars of democratic governance have provided substantial evidence of a lack of responsiveness to groups such as women, low-income populations, and minorities. However, the representation of young adults in the political process has received comparatively little attention. Existing research has focused primarily on the low numbers of young representatives in assemblies and the lack of conventional political participation, overlooking a critical question. Is there a gap in the representation of young adults in political outcomes? Adopting a comprehensive approach that integrates dynamic and group representation mechanisms, this thesis examines whether the interests of young voters are adequately met and identifies the key factors that influence legislators’ responsiveness. Using two-way linear fixed effects (2FE) regressions on data from 25 wealthy democracies over the past twenty years, the study identifies broad trends affecting the representation of young adults. Contrary to traditional assumptions, the results show that common characteristics, rather than electoral strategies, are the primary drivers of politicians’ deliberations. This challenges the prevailing narrative that low voter turnout among young adults is the primary reason for their underrepresentation. The study underscores the importance of group representation in shaping political outcomes, highlighting the urgent need to address numerical representation gaps, particularly in the face of impending demographic shifts toward older societies and increased dependence on young adults.*
