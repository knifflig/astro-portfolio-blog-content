## Motivation

Harnessing the power of both survey data and advanced content analysis techniques, I enjoy exploring the dimensions of social identities, including gender, age, and other social divisions. My work involves the use of modern data analysis tools such as web scraping and Twitter data analysis. These analytical approaches allow for the segmentation of social structures and human behavior, serving as an essential tool in the development of policy and communication strategies. Positioned at the intersection of data analytics and social insights, this knowledge enables me to deliver actionable strategies for diverse audiences.
