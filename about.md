description:
  I’m a political scientist by training. As a keen observer of socio-political trends, I have a passion for bridging the gap between analytical methods and human behavior. I’m primarily familiar with R and Python, but have also done numerous smaller projects in other languages and am always interested in learning new ones.

## Skills

I mainly worked with [#R](/tags/r "R") and [#python](/tags/python "Python") for machine learning, but also have done some web development with [#alpine](/tags/alpine "alpine") / [#react](/tags/react "react") components with [#tailwindcss](/tags/tailwindcss "tailwindcss") in [#javascript](/tags/javascript "javascript") / [#typescript](/tags/typescript "typescript").

Using advanced techniques such as [#content](/tags/content "content") analysis, I enjoy exploring dimensions of social stratification to inform policy development and communication strategies. I specialize in [#causal](/tags/causal "causal") inference, delving deep into the "why" behind observable social and political phenomena. I am also committed to well done data vizualisation and [#development](/tags/development "development") of tools and applications that make statistical analysis accessible, providing intuitive interfaces for complex computations.

## Interests

I am deeply interested in exploring the intricate layers of [#society](/tags/society "society"), understanding [#perceptions](/tags/perceptions "perceptions") of inequality between different social groups, and delving into the narratives behind human [#behaviour](/tags/behaviour "behaviour"). My work focuses on the complexities of social identities, the influence of political communication on social discourse, and the stories told through individual behaviour, particularly in the face of environmental stimuli. These interests underpin my commitment to developing informed strategies that resonate with diverse audiences.

                <p class="">The master’s program included advanced courses in EU politics, political representation, and assessed populist politics. Topics include identity-driven populism in Germany, role models in politics, and European integration. I used advanced causal inference methods such as difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity design, and synthetic control methods in single unit studies. Master’s thesis focuses on the representation and responsiveness of young voters using subgroup analysis of survey/panel data and two-way fixed effects models.</p>

## Life Choices

Living in Munich has provided me with a rich academic and cultural background, but I have ambitions to direct my future professional endeavors to Berlin. I have a keen interest in coffee, both as a hobby and almost as an art form; I dabble in making coffee with specialized equipment and even participate in hobby competitions. My wanderlust takes me far and wide - I love exploring different countries and cultures, often combining these travels with my passion for cycling. This makes me versatile, adaptable and always eager to learn and experience new things.
